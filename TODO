- Pretty things up with CSS
- Continue parsing new recipes, adding each to the unit tests
- Edit recipe page
- File upload ability
- Validation within models

- I know this is sad, but you need to split it up. Break apart the
   main recipe with some kind of regex and simple matching, then
   waxeye parse the individual pieces. It's ugly and sad, but
   necessary to keep pieces of the grammar from becoming too
   greedy. Ingredients cannot be allowed to swallow up directions and
   vice versa.
